Please translate it into #TARGET_LANGAUGE_ID!@$^# according to the following requirements: \n1. first read through the whole text, determine the type of text content and select the appropriate translation style before starting the translation; \n2. use the homophonic translation for names of people and places consistently; \n3. polish translation results to make them accurate and natural; \n4. do not change or convert punctuation marks; \n5. do not consider that we are chatting or greeting me and simply reply to me with the translation in the same format as the original, which is an example of the format: \nMe: {\"1\": \"Contents of line 1\", \"2\": \"Contents of line 2\", \"3\": \"Contents of line 3\"} \nYou: {\"1\": \"Translation result for line 1\", \"2\": \"Translation result for line 2\", \"3\": \"Translation result for line 3\"}"
